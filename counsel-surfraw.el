;; `counsel-surfraw' performs web searches from Emacs using several
;; different search engines, by way of Surfraw.  Surfraw is a command
;; line tool; basically a bunch of individual shell scripts (which
;; it calls "elvi") that builds a query URL for a specific search
;; engine.  You will usually need to install surfraw; on Ubuntu it
;; is as simple as "apt-get install surfraw".
;;
;; There are two parts to the `counsel-surfraw' command; first it
;; asks the user for the search string, then it provides the user
;; with a list of installed search engines ("elvi").  The second
;; part makes use of ivy/counsel.
